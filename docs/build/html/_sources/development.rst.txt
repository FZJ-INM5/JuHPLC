Development
===========

This software relies on Django and Vue heavily. If you are not familiar with their respective concepts yet, I'd suggest to take a look at them before reading any further.

WebApp/Webapp/Settings.py file
------------------------------
This file contains the django configuration.

The most imporant configuration parameters here are the following:

DATABASES
_________
This parameter controls which Database-Backend will be used for persisting the data.

The Default is to use an sqlite database for everything.

Commented you will see an exmaple configuration for a MySQL/Mariadb-Backend.

All Database-engines supported by Django are supported here, so feel free to play around with using PostgreSQL or any other of the supported backends.

STATIC_ROOT
___________

This is the static directory that will be served by the Django-internal Webserver.

STATIC_URL
___________

This is the URL of the static directory. This means by accessing http://localhost/static/ you will be able to access the files from the static directory.

COMPRESS_ENABLED
________________

This Option controls the compressing of included Javascript and Css files.

This has to be ``True`` (default) to enable the html export, as the re requirements will be packed into the single html file and served as this.

The Runtime-implications of this are neglectable since the additional time to compress the files is saved by only requiring one socket.

CHROMIUM_PATH
_____________

This is the path to the chromium executable.

If you want to use PDF exports, this is required to be set to a valid executable.

On Linux-systems (default) this should point to ``chromium-browser``.

On Windows-systems this setting could point to ``D:\\chrome-win32\\chrome.exe``. 

.. note:: Double-backslashes are required to prevent misinterpretation as escape-sequence.

SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST
__________________________

This setting makes sure user-sessions are refreshed with every request. 

This prevents unexpected session termination during normal operation.

I'd suggest keeping this set to ``True`` (default). Only change this if you know what you're doing.
